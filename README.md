## Munhna bounding curves

**Bonding curves** are mathematical functions that establish a relationship between the price of a token and its supply. They play a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and token economics by providing a mechanism for determining token prices based on supply and demand dynamics. Different types of bonding curves, such as linear, polynomial, sub-linear, and S-curve, offer unique price dynamics and serve specific purposes.


One of the key benefits of bonding curves is that they enable token issuance and investment without the need for collateral. Users can purchase tokens directly from the curve, and the price dynamically adjusts based on the token's supply. This eliminates the requirement for external liquidity sources and centralized exchanges, facilitating continuous trading and liquidity provision. Additionally, bonding curves provide an opportunity to pump the value of tokens as demand increases. By attracting more buyers, the price of the tokens can rise, creating profit potential for early adopters.

### Linear Curve
Experience the straightforward elegance of our Linear Bonding Curve, where the token price rises or falls in a linear fashion as the token supply increases or decreases. With a simple formula in play, you can rely on a pricing mechanism that offers transparency and predictability, keeping your project on a stable and consistent path.

### Polynomial Curve
Unlock the power of the Polynomial Curve, where token pricing takes on a captivating curved path driven by a versatile formula. With the Polynomial Curve, your token's value can experience exponential growth, controlled fluctuations, or tailored trajectories based on the values assigned to the coefficients (a, b, c, d) and powers (n) in the formula. This flexibility enables you to create unique token economics that aligns with your project's vision.
